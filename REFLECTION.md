In this assignment I learned about how to create a local git repository and how to use it to manage saves, changes and versions of the same code through various branchs. I also learned how to commit changes to those various branches as well as restore to previous versions in the event of a mistake. Finally I learned how to merge branches and parse through the merging code in the event of a conflict in order to locate and remedy an issue.
